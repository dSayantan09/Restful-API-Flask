GET requests pass data through the URL as query parameters, making the data visible in the address bar. Because of this, GET requests are typically used for retrieving non-sensitive information. They can be cached, bookmarked, and stored in browser history. However, GET requests are limited in length due to URL length restrictions and only allow data to be sent in ASCII format. GET is considered a safe and idempotent method as it does not change the server state.\n",

Unlike GET, POST requests pass data in the body of the HTTP request rather than in the URL, allowing for larger amounts of data and a wider variety of content types including binary data. Because POST data is not visible in the URL, it offers relatively better security for sensitive data. POST requests are not cached or bookmarked and do not remain in browser history. They are not idempotent since submitting the same POST request multiple times may cause different effects, such as creating multiple records. POST is commonly used for submitting form data, uploading files, and triggering server-side modifications or processes"
